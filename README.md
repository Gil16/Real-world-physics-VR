# Real world physics VR experience

Virtual Reality Project in the GIP (Geometric Image Processing) Lab at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology.

An algorithm that stimulates real-life physical elements (gravity and wind), affecting an object thrown at a target.

The object direction and velocity are based on the hand throwing movement.

We developed the project using Unity 2018.4.5f1 environment, scripted with C# in Visual Studio 2019 and used HTC VIVE headset and trackers.
